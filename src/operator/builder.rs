/// OperatorBuilder is a typed builder to builder an Operator.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// OpenDAL uses static dispatch internally and only perform dynamic
/// dispatch at the outmost type erase layer. OperatorBuilder is the only
/// public API provided by OpenDAL come with generic parameters.
///
/// It's required to call `finish` after the operator built.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// For users who want to support many services, we can build a helper function like the following:
///
/// ```
/// use std::collections::HashMap;
///
/// use opendal::layers::LoggingLayer;
/// use opendal::layers::RetryLayer;
/// use opendal::services;
/// use opendal::Builder;
/// use opendal::Operator;
/// use opendal::Result;
/// use opendal::Scheme;
///
/// fn init_service<B: Builder>(cfg: HashMap<String, String>) -> Result<Operator> {
///     let op = Operator::from_map::<B>(cfg)?
///         .layer(LoggingLayer::default())
///         .layer(RetryLayer::new())
///         .finish();
///
///     Ok(op)
/// }
///
/// async fn init(scheme: Scheme, cfg: HashMap<String, String>) -> Result<()> {
///     let _ = match scheme {
///         Scheme::S3 => init_service::<services::S3>(cfg)?,
///         Scheme::Fs => init_service::<services::Fs>(cfg)?,
///         _ => todo!(),
///     };
